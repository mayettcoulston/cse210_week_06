# Asteroids
Asteroids is a game where the player is a ship and tries to shoot as many asteroids as possible to gain points. If one asteroid touches your ship, you lose. You play this game on a simulated terminal, with a visual interface.
## Getting Started

Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer and Raylib Python CFFI 3.7 installed and running on your machine. You can install Raylib Python CFFI by opening a terminal and running the following command.
```

```
After you've installed the required libraries, open a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.```
